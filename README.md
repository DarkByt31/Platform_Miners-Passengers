# Platform_Miners-Passengers
This app was made during SIH-18, for involving passengers in upkeepment of railway station.

It is meant to be used by the passengers who commute by train.
While in a railway station, passengers can flag any problem that they find in a platform so that staff can tkae an immediate action.
Passengers can select an appropriate problem type and optionally write a description of it. Along with the problem type and description, 
current location of the user is also sent, so that staff can know the exact place where the problem arose.

When the passenger opens the app, using Google places API and current location, it finds the railway staion that the passenger
is currently in. This helps to make different directory on the server, due to which staff of a station receives the notifications 
regarding their station only.

Other than flagging, passengers can also give their PNR number using which the app will show the exact place/coordinate on the Google 
Map where the coach of the train will arrive.
